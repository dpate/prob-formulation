\section*{Conclusions}
In this paper, we have presented an approach for describing MDAO problems with constructs and syntax from graph theory.
Our graph description shares similarities to other approaches such as REMS, $\Psi$, FDT,
DSM, and XDSM, but it provides new constructs tailored to algorithmic analysis and
manipulation. The proposed syntax has applications in early phases of MDAO problem
formulation, especially for problems with large numbers of variables and analyses.

In particular, we introduce the concepts of the Maximally Connected Graph (MCG) and
the Fundamental Problem Graph (FPG).
The MCG addresses the question, ``Given a set of analysis tools,
what are all of the variable interconnections between them that could be established?''
The MCG provides a structured formalism to identify \textit{holes} and
\textit{collisions} in interconnections between the set of analysis tools.
In order to achieve a valid problem formulation, all of the holes and collisions must
be resolved. We present an algorithm to perform this resolution which guarantees that an FPG will be found if one exists. In some cases, this algorithm relies on additional input from the
designers to make decisions. One benefit of a graph theoretic approach is the standard
algorithms that can be used to inform the user's decisions, such as cycle detection,
minimum spanning trees, and shortest path algorithms.

The FPG is a graph that describes a data connection structure corresponding
to an MDAO problem formulation free of collisions and holes.
An FPG is the result of user choices to fill holes and resolve collisions in
the initial MCG. Typically, many different FPGs could be attained from a given MCG,
depending on the user choices. The number of possible FPGs that can be attained by
selecting different design variables or introducing additional analysis tools to
fill holes and/or resolve collisions can be viewed as a measure of the freedom
available to the user in implementing the available analysis tools to
formulate valid MDAO problems. In Sec.~\ref{s:example problem},
we provide an example application of formulating multiple FPGs from an MCG
for a commercial aircraft design problem.

%Techniques such as REMS and $\Psi$ focus on developing partitioned subproblems corresponding a given fundamental problem formulation. 

Our graph-based approach is intended primarily to infer possible fundamental problem formulations, via their corresponding FPGs.  However, the syntax also facilitates the development of a Problem Solution Graph (PSG) that describes the MDAO partitioning and coordination strategy based on a specified FPG.  The formulation of a PSG could take advantage of other methods such as $\Psi$, REMS, and XDSM to assist in the specification of subproblem partitions and the addition of coordination-specific elements such as drivers and compatibility constraints.

For simple problems with few analysis tools and variables, the formulation of a
valid problem description is straightforward. However, MDAO problems continue to
grow in scale and complexity. As the numbers of analysis tools and variables have
increased, it has become increasingly challenging and time consuming for engineering
teams to determine how the multiple analysis tools can be interconnected to produce
valid problem formulations, to know when other tools must be introduced, and to
determine the number of free variables in the problem that can or should be
varied by the designer or an optimizer. The graph formalism presented in this
paper is intended to offer value in this context of increasing problem complexity by
providing a formal approach to systematically identify and resolve missing and
redundant data in order to create valid MDAO problem formulations.
